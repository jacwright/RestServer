## Jacwright RESTServer v1.2.0

A PHP REST server for providing a very light-weight REST API. Very easy to set up and get going. Independent from other libraries and frameworks. Supports HTTP authentication.

## Simple REST server in PHP

After building a couple of RESTful services using the [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/), I decided to create a dead simple REST server that allowed me to skip all the features I didn’t need as well as a **tons of classes** that came with Zend Framework MVC. There are still useful features to add (XML support for example), but overall I’m quite happy with what I’ve come up with.

My solution, `RestServer`, is a JSON REST server, so far. It should be trivial to add support for XML or other formats, but there would have to be assumptions on what your object would look like in XML (XML-RPC style, your own custom XML format, etc). First we’ll look at the classes that you write to handle the requests, then we’ll look at how to tie it together in your index.php file.

### REST Controllers

The `RestServer` class assumes you are using URL rewriting and looks at the URL from the
request to map to the necessary actions. The map that gets a request from URL to class
method is all in the doc-comments of the classes. Here is an example of a class that
would handle some user actions:

```php
class TestController
{
    /**
     * Returns a JSON string object to the browser when hitting the root of the domain
     *
     * @url GET /
     */
    public function test()
    {
        return "Hello World";
    }

    /**
     * Logs in a user with the given username and password POSTed. Though true
     * REST doesn't believe in sessions, it is often desirable for an AJAX server.
     *
     * @url POST /login
     */
    public function login()
    {
        $username = $_POST['username'];
        $password = $_POST['password'];
        // validate input and log the user in
    }

    /**
     * Gets the user by id or current user
     *
     * @url GET /users/$id
     * @url GET /users/current
     */
    public function getUser($id = null)
    {
        if ($id) {
            $user = User::load($id); // possible user loading method
        } else {
            $user = $_SESSION['user'];
        }

        return $user; // serializes object into JSON
    }

    /**
     * Saves a user to the database
     *
     * @url POST /users
     * @url PUT /users/$id
     */
    public function saveUser($id = null, $data)
    {
        // ... validate $data properties such as $data->username, $data->firstName, etc.
        $data->id = $id;
        $user = User::saveUser($data); // saving the user to the database
        return $user; // returning the updated or newly created user object
    }

    /**
     * Gets user list
     *
     * @url GET /users
     */
    public function listUsers($query)
    {
        $users = array('Andra Combes', 'Valerie Shirkey', 'Manda Douse', 'Nobuko Fisch', 'Roger Hevey');
        if (isset($query['search'])) {
          $users = preg_grep("/$query[search]/i", $users);
        }
        return $users; // serializes object into JSON
    }
}
```

Let’s walk through the above `TestController` class to talk about the features demonstrated. First we’ll look at the `test` method. You’ll notice there is a new kind of doc-comment tag in the docblock. `@url` maps a URL to the method below it and is in the form:

`@url <REQUEST_METHOD> <URL>`

In this particular example, when someone does a GET on http://www.example.com/ (assuming example.com is where our service is located) it will print out:

`"Hello World"`

which is a valid representation of a string in JSON.

Moving on to the next method, `login`, we see the `@url` maps any POSTs to http://www.example.com/login to the `login` method. Getting data from a regular web-type POST is the same as any PHP application, allowing you to use your own validation or other framework in conjunction with this REST server. Sessions can also be kept if desired. Though keeping sessions isn’t true REST style, often all we want a REST server for is to serve up data to our ajax application, and it can be easier to just use sessions than something more RESTful.

Next we have our `getUser` method (you’ll notice that it doesn’t really matter what I name my methods because our `@url` directives define what URLs map to the method). You can see a couple of things here. First, we have multiple `@url` mappings for this method. And second, there is an odd `/$id` in that first URL mapping. RestServer treats any `:keyword` placeholders as wildcards in the URL and will take that section of the URL and pass it into the parameter with the same name in the method. In this example, when hitting http://www.example.com/users/1234, `$id` will equal 1234. When hitting http://www.example.com/users/current, `$id` will equal null. It doesn’t matter what order your parameters are in, so long as they have the same name as the placeholder (`:id` and `$id`, `:username` and `$username`). You’ll also want to be sure to make your parameters optional (`$id = null`) when you have several URL mappings that don’t all require a parameter. Otherwise you’ll have an error thrown telling you that you didn’t pass in a required parameter.

One last thing to note in `getUser` is that this method simply returns a `User` object. This gets serialized into JSON (or potentially XML) and printed out for consumption by the application.

Next we have to `saveUser`. You see here we have multiple URL mappings again. This time they also have different HTTP methods (POST and PUT) for creating and updating a user. The new thing here is the `$data` variable. This is a special keyword parameter that will contain the value of whatever was POSTed or PUT to the server. This is different than your regular web POST in that it doesn’t need to only be name-value pairs, but can be as robust as JSON, sending complex objects. For example, the body of a regular web POST, let’s say the login request, might look like this:

`username=bob&password=supersecretpassw0rd`

but POSTing a new user object for our saveUser method could look like this:

```json
{ "username": "bob", "password": "supersecretpassword", "firstName": "Bob", "lastName": "Smith" }
```

So you’re able to allow POSTing JSON in addition to regular web style POSTs.

Finally we get to `listUsers` method. It is simple as `test` method. but `$query` parameter is the new. This special parameter can be used to read query string. and hold query string parameters as associated array. for example if client request this API with url `/users?search=Manda` then `$query` parameter will hold `[search => Manada]`.

I call these classes that handle the requests `Controllers`. And they can be completely self-contained with their URL mappings, database configs, etc. so that you could drop them into other RestServer services without any hassle.

### REST index.php

In order to get the whole server kicked off, you’ll want to create an index.php file, have your URL rewriting direct requests to it (another topic which you can learn about elsewhere), and create the RestServer and add controller classes to it for handling. RestServer will cache the URL mappings between requests using APC or a file to speed up requests. You won’t have to load every controller file on every request if you use autoload and this cache, only the one needed for the request. The cache only runs in production mode. Here is an example index.php file:

```php
spl_autoload_register(); // don't load our classes unless we use them

$mode = 'debug'; // 'debug' or 'production'
$server = new RestServer($mode);
// $server->refreshCache(); // uncomment momentarily to clear the cache if classes change in production mode

$server->addClass('TestController');
$server->addClass('ProductsController', '/products'); // adds this as a base to all the URLs in this class

$server->handle();
```

That’s it. You can add as many classes as you like. If there are conflicts, classes added later will overwrite duplicate URL mappings that were added earlier. And the second parameter in addClass can be a base URL which will be prepended to URL mappings in the given class, allowing you to be more modular.

You can [view the RestServer class](https://github.com/jacwright/RestServer/blob/master/RestServer.php), copy it and use it for your own purposes. It is under the MIT license. Features to be added include XML support and HTTP Authentication support. If you make this class better please share your updates with everyone by leaving a comment. I will try and keep this class updated with new features as they are shared. I hope you enjoy!

Good luck and let me know if you end up using it!

**Update:** I am including an example .htaccess file for anyone who might need it. It will only rewrite requests to files that don’t exist, so you can have images, css, or other PHP files in your webroot and they will still work. Anything that would give a 404 will redirect to your index.php file.

```
DirectoryIndex index.php
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^$ index.php [QSA,L]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]
</IfModule>
```

### Authentication and Authorization

Authentication is unique for each application. But tying your authentication mechanisms into RestServer is easy. By simply adding `authenticate` and `authorize` methods to your `Controller` all requests will call these methods first. If `authenticate()` or `authorize()` returns false, the server will issue a **401 Invalid credentials** or **403 Unauthorized** response respectively. If both `authenticate()` and `authorize()` returns true, the request continues on to call the correct controller action. All actions will run the authorization first unless you add `@noAuth` in the action's docs (I usually put it above the `@url` mappings).

You can select authentication and authorization methods as per your requirements you can implement only `autenticate` if you want to confirm client identity. Or you can implement both, then `authorize` can help to confirm if current client is allowed to access a certain action. For more details about authentication. and how to use `JWT` token as bearer header please check example file `TestAuthControll.php`.

Currently default authentication handler support **Basic** and **Bearer** headers based authentication. and pass `[username, password]` or `bearer token` respectively to `authenticate()` method in your controller. In case you want to authenticate clients using some other method like cookies, You can do that inside `authenticate` method. You may replace default authentication handler by passing your own implementation of `AuthServer` interface to RestServer instance. like 

```php
    /**
     * include following lines after $server = new RestServer($mode); 
     */
    $server->authHandler = new myAuthServer();
```

RestServer is meant to be a simple mechanism to map your application into a REST API and pass requested data or headers. The rest of the details are up to you.

### Cross-origin resource sharing

For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP or REST requests initiated from within scripts. So, a web application using REST APIs from browsers, could only make API requests to its own domain. To override this restriction `RestServer` can be configured to allow cros-orign requests, by including following code in REST index.php file.

```php
    /**
     *
     * include following lines after $server = new RestServer($mode); 
     */
     $server->useCors = true;
     $server->allowedOrigin = 'http://example.com';
     // or use array of multiple origins
     $server->allowedOrigin = array('http://example.com', 'https://example.com');
     // or a wildcard
     $server->allowedOrigin = '*';
```

### Working with files
Using Multipart with REST APIs is a bad idea and neither it is supported by `RestServer`. RestServer uses direct file upload approach like S3 services. you can upload one file per request without any additional form data. 

* **Upload:**
In file uploads action you may use two special parameters in method definition. `$data` and `$mime` first parameter will hold file content and the `$mime` parameter can provide details about file content type.

* **Download:**
RestServer will start a file download in case a action return `SplFileInfo` object.

For more details please check `upload` and `download` methods in example.

### Throwing and Handling Errors

You may provide errors to your API users easily by throwing an excetion with the class `RestException`. Example:

```php
    /**
     * Gets the user by id or current user
     *
     * @url GET /users/$id
     * @url GET /users/current
     */
    public function getUser($id = null)
    {
        if ($id) {
            $user = User::load($id); // possible user loading method

            if (!$user) {
                throw new RestException(404, 'User not found');
            }

        } else {
            $user = $_SESSION['user'];
        }

        return $user; // serializes object into JSON
    }
```


You have control over how your REST service handles errors. You can add an error controller using `$server->addErrorClass('ErrorController');`. This controller can define methods named `handle401` or `handle404` to add your own custom error handling logic.
